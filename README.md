2. **Set Up a Virtual Machine (VM)**:  
   Provision a virtual machine with Docker or use a container service (e.g., ECS, Fargate).

3. **Set Up Networking and Domain**:  
   Configure networking for the VM and set up domain names for the public-facing website and API service. You will need two domains (or subdomains):  
   - One for the website (e.g., `https://www.dashitoon.com`)
   - One for the API service (e.g., `https://api-dashitoon.com`)

#### Step 2: Set Up External Services

1. **Google OAuth 2.0**:  
   Follow [this guide](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) to create OAuth 2.0 credentials. You will need the `client_id` and `client_secret`.

2. **Currency API**:  
   Create an account at [Currency API](https://app.currencyapi.com/dashboard) to obtain the API key for currency conversions.

3. **Postmark API**:  
   - Sign up for an account at [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/).
   - Under the "Servers" tab, create a new server.
   - Copy the Server API Token for later use.

4. **AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)**:  
   - Sign in to AWS and navigate to S3.
   - Create a new S3 bucket for media storage.
   - Create a new IAM user with programmatic access and attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy.
   - Save the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

5. **OpenAI API**:

7. **ElasticSearch**:  
   - Sign up for an account at [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud).
   - Create a deployment and copy the **CloudID**.
   - Navigate to Kibana > Management > Security > API Keys and create an API key with index privileges for "dashi-toon-series-index" (read, write, create, delete).

   - Replace `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` with the PayPal **Client ID** from the previous step.

   - Open `appsettings.json` in the `DashiToonAPI.Web` project and update the following:
     - `FrontEndHost`: Set to the public-facing website domain (e.g., `https://www.dashitoon.com`).
     - `Authentication.Google.*`: Add the Google OAuth credentials.
     - `PostMarkToken`: Add the Postmark API token.
